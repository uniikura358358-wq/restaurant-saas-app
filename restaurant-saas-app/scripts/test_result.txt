✅ SUCCESS: The most common and versatile way to say "OK" in Japanese is:

*   **いいよ (ii yo)** - This is a very common and casual "OK." It can also mean "It's good" or "It's fine."

Here are some other options, depending on the context and nuance you want to convey:

*   **はい (hai)** - This is a general "yes" and can often be used as "OK," especially in more formal situations.
*   **わかりました (wakarimashita)** - This means "I understand" or "I got it." It's polite and shows that you've comprehended what was said and agree to it.
*   **大丈夫です (daijoubu desu)** - This means "It's okay" or "It's alright."  It can be used when someone asks if you're alright or if something is acceptable.
*   **うん (un)** - This is a very casual "yeah" or "uh-huh," similar to "OK" in a relaxed setting.  Use it with close friends and family.
*   **了解しました (ryoukai shimashita)** - This is a more formal and business-like way of saying "Understood" or "Roger that." You might hear it in military or workplace settings.
*   **いいです (ii desu)** - More polite than いいよ, but still means "It's good" or "It's fine."

So, to summarize, if you're unsure, **いいよ (ii yo)** is a safe and versatile choice. If you want to be more polite, go with **わかりました (wakarimashita)**.
